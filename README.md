A very bad and simple GUI for [mokuro](https://github.com/kha-white/mokuro).

# How to run
1. Install the Python dependencies:
````
pip install -r requirements.txt
````
2. If you have a Nvidia GPU, I recommend installing [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) (CUDA 11.8) using `pip` instead of `pip3`.
3. Run the script:
````
python3 main.py
````
4. You can also create a shortcut on windows. Use the `run.vbs` file. Create a shortcut to this file after editing it to set the correct path to this project.
